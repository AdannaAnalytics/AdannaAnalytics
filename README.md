#Hi there 👋, I’m Adanna, a data analyst and visualization expert with a background in Public Health (MPH). I have experience working with International Non Governmental Organizations where I spent over 8 years working with Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition datasets. I am currently transitioning to data analytics because I really enjoy working with data and creating visually appealing data-driven dynamic and interactive dashboards. I post content and relevant resources every other day on my social media pages (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) and on my blog on Medium. PS: I am also passionate about design (I am a UI/UX designer!). You can check me out on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/adannaopara/ on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AdannaOpara1.
